# Sideways World Challenge

The world download for my Minecraft PC [Sideways World Challenge video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb5f0M4WXZjzv8tGZnNqqNbpPRvF7LnJR).

To use it, download this repository and copy the "Sideways World" folder to your Minecraft saves folder.

The seed of the original Minecraft 1.10.2 world I copied terrain from is `4898306531492627858`. When creating it I lowered the sea level, removed water lakes, and lowered the biome and river sizes in the Minecraft world customization menu.
