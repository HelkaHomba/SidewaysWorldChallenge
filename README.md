# SidewaysWorldChallenge

The world download for my Minecraft PC Sideways World Challenge video series.

The seed of the original Minecraft 1.10.2 world I copied terrain from is 4898306531492627858. When creating it I lowered the sea level, removed water lakes, and lowered the biome and river sizes in the Minecraft world customization menu.
